# Diez-et-al._Tau-interactions
_Github repository for the bulk TE analysis of Diez et al. 2025 by Pia Grundschoettel._

In this repository, you can find all the code that has been written by Pia Grundschoettel .... to analyse and visualize the bulk RNA-seq data in Diez et al. 2025:
__Tau interactions with the nuclear envelope modulate neuronal chromatin and nuclear stability__

For this project the data is available under the following GEO accession number: GSE283514.
Hippocampal mouse neurons were genetically modified with adeno-associated viruses to express and overexpress human Tau and knockdown mouse Tau to investigate the consequences of Tau overexpression or knockdown with an focus on locality of the DE genes.

The bulk RNA-seq analysis have been performed in the docker container jsschrepping/r_docker:jss_R430_bioc317_slim, which can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/layers/jsschrepping/r_docker/jss_R430_bioc317_slim/images/sha256-43ffc9fe6d3951590c2b0158d764de9e48ace35a4d3756eff0acf3ce6454baa2)
